The first phone I got was a Google Pixel 2 XL. I got it in August 2021. I got it front Mint Mobile (New, Black, 64GB) for $95, with a $50 discount for buying it with a Mint Mobile phone plan, so it ended up costing $45 for the phone. It is a pretty good phone, even in 2024, 7 years after it was released. Its last Android update was Android 11. I installed LienageOS on it, and as of now, it is a supported device on LineageOS with Android 14. However, since July 2024, I've been having problems with SystemUI not responding and then restarting on LineageOS. I'm not sure if it's a bug with LineageOS, a hardware problem, or both. Because of the problem I switched phones. I used this phone for 3 years, so that was an average of $31.67/year + taxes, or $15/year if you count the Mint Mobile deal. Pretty good. This phone is pretty usable in 2024. 

What I like:
- Stero Speakers
- 1440p Screen
- LTE connectivity (pretty good compared to other phones in my house (Samsung Galaxy A51, iPhone 11, iPhone 15)
- Squeeze sensor
- Camera (pretty bad compard to other phones but completely usable for me)
- Battery life
- Performance (still good for casual phone use in 2024)

What I dislike:
- The big size makes it hard to put in pockets. Unfortunately there are not many options for smaller phones, and these days even phones without "XL" in their name are just as big as the Pixel 2 XL, or bigger
- Big bezels (not a problem, but the newer phones make the Pixel 2 XL's bezels look bad in comparison)

I currently have crDroid on this phone but it is not my daily driver.
