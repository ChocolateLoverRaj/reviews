I got this tablet in 2016. It was a pretty good tablet for watching videos and playing games. It has 32GB internal storage and a microSD card slot. I played Brawl Stars on it a lot with no problems. The last update it got was Android 7.0, so in 2024, this tablet is ancient and not very useful. I put an unnoficial LineageOS on it with Android 13, which is missing many features (camera, fingerprint sensor, GAPPS), but is still good for playing Brawl Stars and watching Netflix.
