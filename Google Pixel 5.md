I bought this phone on September 11, 2024 for $102 on Wisetek Market. It said "Fair" condition, but the phone that arrived looks pretty flawless to me, so to me it's like new with ~90 battery cyles. And the color is green, which is my preffered color. Wisetek Market did not say anything about the color on their website, so I got lucky. Even though the phone no longer gets updates from Google, it matches everything I want in a smartphone: 
- Small size
- Good battery life
- Fingerprint sensor on the back
- 90Hz display
- 5G
- eSIM
- Wireless Charging

The last update the Pixel 5 got was November 2023, but it is still a popular phone and has support on LineageOS and crDroid. I am using it with crDroid, and it has been my daily driver for 3 days now. I do not regret buying this phone and I can clearly feel the improvement compared to Google Pixel 2 XL and Samsung Galaxy A51. Here is what I noticed and like: 
- The 90Hz display looks great, noticeably better than the 60Hz displays that I'm used to. It makes the phone feel super fast and responsive
- Having 8GB RAM instead of 4GB RAM probably also makes it much smoother
- The processor is also noticably faster, and Farmville 2 feels much smoother
- Wireless charging is convenient. I can leave the phone powered by the wireless charger, pick it up whenever I want to do something, and then just place it down on the charger when I'm done. However, there are two concerns I have
  - I noticed the battery gets warm when powered by a wireless charger (around 33℃ to 37.6℃)
  - The wireless charger is using up a ton of power, maybe wasting a significant amount of electricity
  - I got up to 250mbps 5G speeds with Tello!
- The small size makes it easier to hold and keep in pockets

I plan to use this phone until...
- It breaks
- It stops working
- It stops getting LineageOS / crDroid updates and the Android version gets too old
- There is a newer, much better phone that is also small
