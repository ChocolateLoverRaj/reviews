I used a friend/family member's old Samsung Galaxy A51 after my Pixel 2 XL had problems.

What I like
- Screen-to-body ratio
- Face and fingerprint unlock
- Performance is ok, not as good as Pixel 2 XL but still perfectly usable in 2024
- Camera (better than Pixel 2 XL)
- Battery life (no problems 3.5 years since bought)
- Speaker is ok
- Good LTE speeds
- Option to only charge up to 85%

What I don't like
- Big size (just as big as Pixel 2 XL, but this phone doesn't even have "XL" in its name)
- Cannot be easily modded / rooted like Google Pixel phones

I still have this phone (unmodded, Android 13), but no longer use it.
